# Kaggle-Titanic-Estimator
I decided to play around with Kaggle's Titanic dataset that offers data on those people who survived the Titanic incident and those who perished. The estimator is a neural network that attempts to learn the probability of survival given a few chosen features from the dataset.

The dataset is, of course, not mine, though the Machine Learning done on it is code I've written with reference back to tutorials I've completed earlier. The highest accuracy obtained so far is 75%. A bit of poking around revealed that a decision tree is a much better choice for the problem.
